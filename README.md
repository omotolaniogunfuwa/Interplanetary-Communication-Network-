# Decentralized Interplanetary Communication Network (DICN)

## Overview
The Decentralized Interplanetary Communication Network (DICN) is a blockchain-based system designed to facilitate secure and efficient communication across planetary bodies in the solar system. By leveraging smart contracts and distributed systems, DICN provides a resilient infrastructure for interplanetary data transmission.


## Core Components

### Relay Node Contract
The backbone of the DICN system, managing communication nodes distributed across different planets and space stations.

Key features:
- Node registration and verification
- Health monitoring and status reporting
- Dynamic node discovery
- Automatic failover mechanisms
- Gravitational delay compensation
- Cross-planetary consensus mechanisms

### Data Packet Routing Contract
Intelligent routing system optimizing message delivery across vast distances.

Key features:
- Adaptive routing based on astronomical positions
- Light-time delay calculations
- Multi-path transmission
- Priority-based message queuing
- Network congestion management
- Store-and-forward capabilities

### Encryption Contract
Provides quantum-resistant security measures for interplanetary communications.

Key features:
- Post-quantum cryptographic algorithms
- Key distribution across planetary nodes
- Message authentication
- Forward secrecy
- Anti-tampering mechanisms
- Emergency key rotation protocols

### Resource Allocation Contract
Manages system resources to ensure optimal network performance.

Key features:
- Dynamic bandwidth allocation
- Power consumption optimization
- Storage management
- Quality of Service (QoS) enforcement
- Resource prediction algorithms
- Cross-planetary load balancing

## Technical Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
- Quantum-compatible processing units
- High-gain antenna arrays
- Redundant power systems
- Radiation-hardened storage
- Specialized cooling systems

### Software Requirements
- Ethereum-compatible blockchain client
- Post-quantum cryptography libraries
- Distributed consensus algorithms
- Space-time synchronization protocols
- Orbital mechanics calculation engine

## Installation

1. Deploy base station hardware infrastructure
2. Initialize quantum processing units
3. Deploy smart contracts in the following order:
    - Resource Allocation Contract
    - Encryption Contract
    - Relay Node Contract
    - Data Packet Routing Contract
4. Configure initial node parameters
5. Perform system-wide synchronization

## Usage

### Node Registration
```solidity
function registerNode(
    bytes32 planetaryLocation,
    uint256 capacityBandwidth,
    bytes32 publicKey
) external returns (bool)
```

### Message Transmission
```solidity
function sendMessage(
    bytes32 destinationAddress,
    bytes calldata message,
    uint256 priority
) external returns (bytes32 messageId)
```

### Resource Management
```solidity
function allocateResources(
    bytes32 nodeId,
    uint256 bandwidthRequest,
    uint256 duration
) external returns (bool)
```

## Security Considerations

- Regular quantum key rotation
- Multi-planetary consensus requirements
- Radiation impact mitigation
- Solar flare protection protocols
- Anti-jamming measures
